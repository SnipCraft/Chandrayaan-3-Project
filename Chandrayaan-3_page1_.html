			<p align="justify">
				<font face="Arial" size=4>Chandrayaan-3 is a planned third lunar exploration mission by the Indian Space
					Research Organisation (ISRO). It will consist of a lander and a rover similar to Chandrayaan-2, but
					would not have an orbiter. Its propulsion module will behave like a communications relay satellite.
					The propulsion module will carry the lander and rover configuration until the spacecraft is in a
					100km lunar orbit.

					<br>

					Chandrayaan-3 is a follow-on mission to Chandrayaan-2 to demonstrate end-to-end capability in safe
					landing and roving on the lunar surface. It will be launched by LVM3 from SDSC SHAR, Sriharikota.
					The propulsion module will carry the lander and rover configuration till 100 km lunar orbit. The
					propulsion module has Spectro-polarimetry of Habitable Planet Earth (SHAPE) payload to study the
					spectral and Polari metric measurements of Earth from the lunar orbit.

						the Chandrayaan program. It was launched by the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) in
						October 2008, and operated until August 2009. The scientific objective of Chandrayaan-1 wasto
						design, develop, launch and orbit a spacecraft around the Moon using an Indian-made
						launch-vehicle. Chandrayaan-2 was the second lunar exploration mission developed by ISRO, after
						Chandrayaan-1. It consists of a lunar orbiter, a lander, and the Pragyan rover, all of which
						were developed in India. The main scientific objective of Chandrayaan-2 was to map and study the
						variations in lunar surface composition, as well as the location and abundance of lunar water.
						However, the lander crashed when it deviated from its intended trajectory while attempting to
						land on 6 September 2019. According to a failure analysis report submitted to ISRO, the crash
						was caused by a software glitch.]</b>
